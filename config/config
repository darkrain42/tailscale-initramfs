# Authkey to be used to authenticate to tailscale.  Passed to "tailscale up"
# --authkey, so can also be file:/path/to/secret (the file will be copied into
# the initramfs).
#
# Note that the config (and any key) is stored in the initramfs, which is
# often outside of a cryptroot.

TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY=

#
# Hostname to pass to "tailscale up".
# Default: ${HOSTNAME}-initramfs.

#
# Command-line options to pass to tailscale, in addition to
# --authkey"${TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY}"
# Default: none

#TAILSCALE_OPTIONS=

#
# Command-line options to pass to tailscaled
# Default: none
#
#TAILSCALED_OPTIONS=

#
# Set to any non-empty string to log out of tailscale before passing out of
# the initramfs. This is ineffective if some other package in the initramfs
# (dropbear-initramfs) brings down the external interfaces.  See IFDOWN in
# dropbear-initramfs's config.
# Default: none
#
#TAILSCALE_LOGOUT=

#
# Space-delimited list of DNS server(s) to put in /etc/resolv.conf in the
# initramfs if /etc/resolv.conf doesn't exist and if no DNS servers were
# returned from DHCP.
#
# Tailscale will eventually fall back to bootstrapping DNS itself, but there's
# no reason to rely on that (adds a slight delay).  Tailscale's fallback is
# also problematic in some corner cases in some versions (see
# https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/6110).
#
#FALLBACK_DNS_SERVERS=

#
# Bring down interfaces matching this pattern before passing out of the
# initramfs.  (Same behavior as dropbear-initramfs)
# Default: *
